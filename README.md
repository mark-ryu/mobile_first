# mobile_first

Template is from Youtube Channel Called Traversy Media.

Created for mobile first concept of desigining websites. Instead of flexbox used in the original template creation. I used CSS Grid.

# Photos Source

The source is my favorite online photo website called unsplash.com. I made the elements random to create at least a not "too" static website.

# flask

The website runs on flask as a backend for the website. Unsecure and only manages static files that is dynamic enough to be uploaded into a server like heroku or other server sites. 

The app is still on debug mode as it is not open for sale or anything but rather for my educational and showcase purposes.

# requirements.txt

The requirements.txt is included as I am using Pipenv to create virtual environments. 

# editors used

Used VsCode and Vim for most of the project
