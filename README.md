# mobile_first

Template is from Youtube Channel Called Traversy Media.

Created for mobile first concept of desigining websites. Instead of flexbox used in the original template creation. I used CSS Grid.

# Photos Source

The source is my favorite online photo website called unsplash.com. I made the elements random to create at least a not "too" static website.
